    <h1>BALOCHISTAN</h1>

    <p>
      Balochistan, also spelled Balūchistān, westernmost province of Pakistan.
      It is bordered by Iran (west), by Afghanistan (northwest),
      by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces (northeast and east), by
      Sindh province (southeast), and by the Arabian Sea (south).
      Although an indigenous population of the region passed through the Stone
      and Bronze ages and was part of Alexander the Great’s empire,
      the Baloch people themselves did not enter the region until the 14th
      century CE. The Baloch and Pashtun (Pathan) people constitute the two
      major
      and more distinct ethnic groups; a mixed ethnic stock, mainly of Sindhi
      origin, forms the third major group. Balochi, Brahui, Pashto,
      and Sindhi are the main languages. Balochistan was established as a
      separate province in its present form in 1970.
      It is the largest and most sparsely populated province in Pakistan. Its
      capital is Quetta.
